This project was very enjoyable.  For my challenges, I chose to include card comments, the ability to assign users
to cards, and drag-and-drop card functionality.  I struggled to complete the assignment in time- even with the
extension (and putting in multiple hours of work over break).  As a result, some features were hastily implemented
and the UI consequently suffered.  Regardless, I am glad to have worked on this project and I certainly learned
a lot about Web Development and my current skill-level as a programmer.
